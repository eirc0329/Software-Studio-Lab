# Lab - Weathermood Toxicity Detection

In this lab, you are asked to add a prediction function of text toxicity to Weathermood, using [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js).

We will be using a pre-trained model from TensorFlow to detect whether a text contains toxic content such as 
- threatening 
- insults
- obscenities, and so on

Then classify the text into three classes: happy / sad / fear, according to the detected toxic type.
